•	Our system consist 3 primary modules. 
1.	Social network based forecasting 
2.	Generic online medical System
3.	Google flu dataset based forecasting 

•	Our solution  provide you answers from our big data healthcare database consisting of tens of millions of healthcare conversations taken place in social media in the country and across the globe. Our database has data for over the last couple of years, providing a unique set of comparative historic data.

•	The data that feeds into the system will be from different geographies and the data will be used to get statistics out of it for each major disease on the particular geographical location for over period of time. For instance, the application can give historical statistics of Flu in Tamil Nadu between two time units and also what may happen in the near future. This helps government and other stockholders to have some clue of potential event in the near term and prepare themselves to tackle the situations in an effective way than ever.

•	In case of rural areas where social networking based analysis is not widely adapted, we offer a common web portal/mobile app where medical practitioner, patients and pharmaceutical shops to enter the prescriptions and diagnosis report in our system.

•	The system would pave ways for generic medicines in country .The system reads the prescriptions and check the presence of drug components of each drug from prescription and it lists the medicines that have the same drug compositions among various brands available in market with its price tag.

•	Also consumer is provided with the information of list of drugs from all the best brands instead of just single brand. So consumer get benefit by choosing the drug at fair price and also avoid consuming sub-stranded drugs which doctors might have prescribed .Medical practitioners who prescribe sub-standard drugs would be kept in check.  

•	Artificial intelligence will be employed on top the reports and metrics to learn the patterns and make the process efficient. AI based analysis forecasts the disease for the individual as well as for masses which may arise in near future.

•	 Geographical based forecasting can also be employed so that the government can prepare to deal seasonal health problems and precautions of the masses more efficiently and government can gain insights into patients’ consumption patterns and health requirements of masses or individuals.

•	Reports will be generated from the system for advanced analytics purposes and from there on, AI will be applied on datasets to find patterns and trends to forecast the upcoming diseases periodically. The dataset used is for our testing is obtained from Google flu trends and the dataset can be found under http://www.google.org/denguetrends   As mentioned earlier, proposed system can forecast exact seasonal and cyclic diseases so the government agencies can take precisions measures.
